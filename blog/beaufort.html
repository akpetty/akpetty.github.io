        <!--<h1>Sea ice circulation around the Beaufort Gyre</h1>-->

        <p>The following blog post was graciously hosted at <a href="http://neven1.typepad.com/blog/beaufort-gyre/"> Neven's Arctic Sea Ice blog.</a></p>
<p><em>The Beaufort Sea ice pack has experienced some significant<a href="http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/IOTD/view.php?id=88065" target="_blank"> breakup events in recent weeks</a>. This has coincided with some pretty active<a href="https://nsidc.org/arcticseaicenews/2016/03/february-continues-streak-of-record-low-arctic-sea-ice-extent/" target="_blank"> Beaufort Gyre ice circulation</a> patterns, leading many (even on this very blog) to discuss the likelihood of a new record sea ice minimum being set this summer. In this feature, I want to talk a bit more generally about the Beaufort Gyre, why it's important, and why the sea ice circulation around the gyre might have changed over the last few decades.</em></p>
<p>The Arctic is replenished with around <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2005JC003424/abstract" target="_blank">ten thousand gigatons of fresh water every year</a> from river runoff into the Arctic basin, Pacific Water inflow (through the Bering Strait), precipitation and - increasingly - sea ice melt.</p>

<p>The predominantly clockwise winds over the northern Beaufort Sea draw in a significant fraction of this freshwater - through a process called Ekman pumping - resulting in a characteristic doming of the ocean surface (a 'spin-up' of the ocean as it is often called).</p>
<p>The combined forces of gravity and Coriolis drive a clockwise ocean current that circulates this relatively fresh surface water - along with its overlying sea ice cover - around the center of the dome (also clockwise). The end result is one of the most prominent features of the Arctic Ocean - the Beaufort Gyre (see Figure 1).</p>
<p>The sea ice sandwiched between the atmosphere and ocean responds to the combined effects of wind and ocean drag and thus modulates <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2013JC009425/abstract" target="_blank">how effectively the winds can 'spin up' the ocean</a>. The interaction between winds, ocean currents and sea ice are intrinsically linked, making it an extremely challenging system to study. We'll get back to this point later.</p>
<p>For those concerned with understanding the fate of Arctic sea ice, the circulation of ice in this region is crucial - as thicker, older ice enters the Beaufort Gyre north of the Canadian Archipelago, but often melts out as it enters the warmer waters north of Alaska. Several decades ago it wasn't uncommon for sea ice to survive a full Beaufort Gyre circuit, although this appears to be happening less and less in recent years, as the younger, thinner ice melts out in the Beaufort Sea (see recent studies <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2015JC010756/abstract">here</a> and <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2015JC011464/abstract">here</a>). The sea ice decline within the Beaufort Gyre has been one of the strongest declines observed across the Arctic, so these mechanisms are worth understanding in detail.</p>
<p>In our <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2015JC010903/full" target="_blank">recent study</a>, we used satellite tracking of sea ice floes to investigate the changing sea ice circulation around the Beaufort Gyre. Our results show that the sea ice circulation increased rapidly in the 2000s, despite no real trend in the wind circulation over the same time period.</p>

JFM:January-March etc. Blue implies an increased tendency for the ice to circulate clockwise.[/caption]The changes were very seasonal, however, with the biggest increase in sea ice circulation occurring in autumn - coinciding with significant decreases in sea ice concentration (Figure 3), thickness (Figure 4), and a latter freeze-up of sea ice in the region.</p>

The gray stars/lines in spring (AMJ) indicate the thickness in the Beaufort Gyre region from IceBridge remote sensing data.[/caption]</p>
<p>Let's look at the possible causes of this enhanced ice circulation in a bit more detail. When sea ice is old, thick, and strong - internal 'ice-ice' stresses make it harder for the winds to drag the sea ice and ocean around. Old sea ice, however, <a href="http://www.the-cryosphere-discuss.net/tc-2015-199/">can also be very rough</a> (compared to the ocean), providing more obstacles for the winds to push against - increasing the effective drag. Alternatively, young sea ice - which is increasingly dominating the Arctic sea ice cover - is often much smoother than old ice, and may in-fact reduce the effective wind drag. Young ice is obviously thinner and weaker too. Melt ponds and broken up sea ice floes provide more complexity to this ice state-effective wind drag relationship, however, especially in summer.</p>
<p>[caption id="attachment_847" align="aligncenter" width="541"]<img class="  wp-image-847 aligncenter" src="https://alekpetty.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/bg_circulation.png?w=2720" alt="BG_CIRCULATION" width="541" height="621" /> Figure 5: Candidate mechanisms that could explain the enhanced Beaufort Gyre ice circulation.[/caption]</p>
<p>The ice-ocean model PIOMAS suggests thickness declines across all seasons in the Beaufort Gyre - including autumn declines of ~50% since the 1980s (see Figure 4). Strong declines appear around 2007 (when we had a record low summer minimum), and this was backed up by independent thickness data derived from upward looking sonar moorings in the Beaufort Sea. This was also the time when we noticed a big difference between the wind and ice drift circulation (technically the <a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Curl.html" target="_blank">curl</a> of the wind and ice drift vectors). The strong thickness declines in winter may explain why we've seen these big winter sea ice breakup events in recent years.</p>
<p>Reductions in concentration (as seen across all seasons in the Beaufort Gyre region) can also significantly reduce the internal 'ice-ice' stresses, increasing the effective ice circulation. When these 'ice-ice' stresses are negligible, we often say the ice is in 'free drift' as the sea ice provides negligible resistance to the wind and/or ocean drag. The strong concentration declines observed in summer, however, are thought to be somewhat irrelevant, as the ice concentration was already low (less than 80% in the 1980s/1990s) and so the ice was probably already in free drift. In autumn, however, the concentration declines were probably a lot more significant, as the ice likely wasn't in free drift (in the 1980s/1990s), but may have entered a state of (or close to) free drift in the 2000s.</p>
<p>The increased heat flux from the ocean to the atmosphere, driven by recent increases in Arctic open water (or decreased ice concentration), has also reduced the stability of the atmospheric boundary layer. A less stable boundary layer can increase the effective wind drag through enhanced turbulent mixing over the sea ice surface.</p>
<p>If the winds do 'spin-up' and strengthen the underlying ocean currents, this can also increase the ice circulation as the ice and ocean circulate more in tandem, reducing the ocean-ice drag. We currently lack reliable, seasonal estimates of the Beaufort Gyre ocean currents, so we still don't know how much of an influence the ocean is having on these changes. We do know that there was a significant <a href="http://www.nature.com/ngeo/journal/v5/n3/full/ngeo1379.html" target="_blank">'spin-up' of the Beaufort Gyre in the 2000s</a> (i.e. it domed and accumulated more freshwater than usual), so it's likely a reduced ocean drag may have contributed to an increased ice circulation also. Again, the big increase was in 2007/2008. The role of sea ice decline in enhancing this 'spin-up' of the Beaufort Gyre in the 2000s, due to the changing effective transfer of momentum between the atmosphere and ocean is still open to speculation.</p>
<p>There are other processes that may also be important (e.g. a freshening of the surface waters), so the quest to understand this complex, coupled system goes on. What we really need now are more detailed observations of the sea ice-ocean-atmosphere system, and/or a well calibrated, <a href="https://alekpetty.wordpress.com/2015/09/07/the-sea-ice-orchestra/">sophisticated</a>, fully coupled atmosphere-sea ice-ocean climate model to test out some of these ideas in more detail. Do get in touch if you have one.</p>
