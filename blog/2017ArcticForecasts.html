        <h3>2017 September Arctic sea ice forecasts: </h3>

<p>A few months ago I published a <a href="/papers/petty2017.html">paper in Earth's Future</a> with several colleagues of mine from NASA and the UK, where we demonstrated 'skillful' seasonal forecasts of summer (September) Arctic sea ice extent. Note that here we define 'skillful' as a forecast that performs better than simply continuing the linear, downward, trend in sea ice. </p>
<p>Our September sea ice forecasts are skillful using obsereved sea ice data from as early as March, and continue to get more skillful as the melt season progresses through late spring and into summer. In general, the forecasts in June onwards become noticably more skillful, so earlier forecasts (like the ones presented in this blog post) should be regarded with caution! The plan is to update this blog series each month as new data regarding the concentration, melt onset, and maybe even melt pond coverage of the Arctic sea ice pack comes in, and our forecasts are expected to be more reliable. </p>

     <figcaption>Fig 1: September Arctic sea ice extent forecasts using April ice concentration data. The vertical lines show the prediction confidence interval (1SD and 2SD) of the 2017 forecast. The bottom panel shows the observed/forecast extent relative to linear trend persistence. </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>For now I've just used satellite derived ice concetration data in April to derive a September Arctic sea ice extent forecast. See Figure 1.</p>
<p><b>The 2017 forecast suggests a September sea ice extent similar to 2016 and the extent expected from the linear trend extent observed in 2016, with a low likelihood of a new record low (less than the record set in 2012) </b></p>
<p>As we can see from the blue line, the April forecasts of September sea ice extent don't do a great job of capturing the extremes in observed ice extent, but do a pretty good job of caturing the ups and downs in ice extent over and above the long term decline (the bottom panel expresses the observations and forecast in terms of the linear trend anomaly). </p>
<p>In Figure 2 we show the regional drivers of this specific 2017 forecast. The red regions indiciate sea ice concentration higher than expected from the long-term trend, while blue regions indicate lower than expected from the trend. The hatched regions highlight regions that historically correlate with September sea ice at this lead time (forecast month). Regions of no historical correlation are not included (we explored this more in the paper, so read that for more information). </p>

     <figcaption>Fig 2: April sea ice concentration anomalies driving the 2017 September Arctic sea ice extent forecast. The hatchings indicate regions of historical correlation to September sea ice extent (R>0.3)</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>This means the strong reds either side of Greenland, that indicate higher than expected ice concentration, aren't being included in this forecast as they have no historical correlation with September ice extent (in my model at least). The 2017 forecast is thus mainly driven by the higher than expected and lwoer than expected concentration around the Kara Sea (north of Scandanavia).</p>
<p>In summary: our early forecast of September Arctic sea ice suggests an ice extent similar to last year and no record low. This forecast isn't hugely reliable, so check back in June and July especially for the more reliable forecasts I shoud be posting. I'll try and include some other datasets and produce some regional forecasts too.</p>
